# ScenTrees.jl

!!! info
	`ScenTrees.jl` is still under development.

`ScenTrees.jl` is a package for generating and improving scenario trees and scenario lattices for multistage stochastic optimization using _stochastic approximation_.

In these tutorials, we assume that the reader is quite familiar with the theory and explanation in the paper _Dynamic Genaration of Scenario Trees by Prof. George Pflug and Prof. Alois Pichler_.

!!! tip 
	If you haven't, you don't have to worry. Here is the link:
	[Dynamic Generation of Scenario Trees](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-015-9758-0)

## Installation

You can install `ScenTrees.jl` as follows:

```julia
]
add https://github.com/kirui93/ScenTrees.jl.git
```

Once you have ScenTrees.jl installed, we recommend that you have a look on the tutorials from the beginning to the end to have a glimpe on how you can use the package to do scenario tree/lattice generation by the stochastic approximation process.
