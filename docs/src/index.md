# ScenTrees.jl

!!! info
	`ScenTrees.jl` is still under development.

`ScenTrees.jl` is a package for generating and improving scenario trees and scenario lattices for multistage stochastic optimization using _stochastic approximation_.
In this explanation, we assume that the reader is quite familiar with the theory and explanation in the paper _Dynamic Genaration of Scenario Trees by Pflug and Pichler_.

!!! tip 
	If you haven't, you don't have to worry. Here is the link:

## Installation

You can install `ScenTrees.jl` as follows:

```julia
]
add https://github.com/kirui93/ScenTrees.jl.git
