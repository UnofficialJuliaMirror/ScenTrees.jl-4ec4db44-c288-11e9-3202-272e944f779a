We have treeplot, plotD and PlotLattice functions.  Each of these functions is special in its own way. Both treeplot and plotD are for plotting scenario trees while PlotLattice is only for plotting lattice. In this package, we deal also with trees of 2D state space. So you can visualize them after approximation using plotD function.  So the main difference between treeplot and plotD is that  treeplot is for trees only in 1D state space while plotD can be used for trees in 1D and 2D but specifically created for trees in 2D state space.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial1/#","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"info: Info\n","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial1/#","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"You need to install the [PyPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl) package for this plots.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial1/#","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"You can save the plots using the the Plots.jl function savefig:","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial1/#","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"Plots.savefig(\"example1.pdf\")","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/tutorial1/#","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"This ends the tutorial for this package.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = ScenTrees","category":"page"},{"location":"#ScenTrees.jl-1","page":"Home","title":"ScenTrees.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"ScenTrees.jl is a package for generating and improving scenario trees and scenario lattices for multistage stochastic optimization using stochastic approximation.
